# ðŸŽ® Steam Games Picker

**Navigate Your Vast Game Library with Ease!**

The Steam Games Picker is a powerful backend system designed to help you (and your friends!) effortlessly narrow down a massive collection of games to find that perfect next pick. Tired of endless scrolling and indecision? A seemingly endless backlog? This application intelligently filters, sorts, and presents games in manageable batches, helping you decide which game to play next.

## Why?

Sometimes picking a game can be difficult! This program is designed to help narrow down what you'd like to play by comparing games, and picking between them until you are down to your top picks. Helpful for a large backlog, you can see each title in front of you (even the ones you bought on sale years ago!).

## ðŸ“± Features:

*   **Intelligent Batch Generation**: Dynamically creates batches of games, reducing the number of choices after each selection.
*   **Interactive Filtering**:
    *   **Finds common games** shared with selected friends.
    *   **Steam filters** by multiple tags, ensuring games possess *all* specified genres or characteristics.
    *   **Filters by playtime**, helping you discover quick sessions or epic sagas.
*   **Comprehensive Tag Extraction**: Automatically gathers all unique tags from your game library for easy filtering options.
*   **Robust State Management (Undo/Redo)**: Never fear a wrong decision! The app maintains a full history of your filtering process, allowing you to freely undo and redo steps until you find your ideal game.
*   **Final Pick Identification**: Clearly identifies the single chosen game once the selection process is complete.
*   **Modular & Tested Design**: Built with robust validation and unit-tested components, ensuring reliability and maintainability.

## ðŸ§© How It Works (Core Logic):

The system leverages a sophisticated `Session` manager that orchestrates `State` objects, each representing a unique snapshot of your game selection journey. Games are intelligently moved between `"remaining,"` `"batch,"` and `"seen"` pools, driven by your confirmations and filtering choices. Core utilities handle complex operations like set intersections for common games and and precise tag-based filtering.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

To set up and run the Steam Games Picker's core logic, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3\.8 or higher installed on your system\.
*   \`tkinter\` library installed (usually included with Python\, but may require a separate system package like \`python3\-tk\` on some Linux distributions)\.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine\:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Team-MEA/SteamGamesPicker.git
cd SteamGamesPicker
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to create a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). This isolates your project's dependencies from your system-wide Python installation, preventing conflicts.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment\. The command depends on your operating system\:

*   **On Linux/macOS**:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
*   **On Windows (Command Prompt)**:
    ```cmd
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
*   **On Windows (PowerShell)**:
    ```powershell
    venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

You should see `(venv)` prepended to your terminal prompt\, indicating the virtual environment is active\.

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

NOTE: if you have issues installing chromium (often occures with WSL terminals) you will need to download and install google chrome

### Step 5: Run the Application

**To run the main application**:

Make sure your virtual environment is active (Step 3). From the project's root directory (`SteamGamesPicker/`),, execute:

```bash
python3 main.py
# or
python main.py
```
